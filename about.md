#### About This Project ####

The goal of this project is to create an application that can predict next word based on user input text. A corpus prediction model was created based on sampling data provided by SwiftKey. This datasets consist of english blogs, news and twitter.    

Most importantly, this application was developed as a final milestone for Johns Hopkins University Coursera Data Science. Good luck to me BTW :)
